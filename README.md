in the file HTML

in this game we are creating a code for tiktaktoe game 
first I did class game has all the squares with different id as small squares (9)

I added the Onclick so I can add a condition functions in JS

In Css
I styled the game with pink and hover black 

JS
i created a condition(game) every time I click it will write X first and O second 

I created a condition (winner )  will compare the squares if they are equale with the same X or O vertically or horizantaly it will show the winnner in the dashboard. And it will give it 4 seconds to reload(reset)
the setinterval will help me showing the result in the dashboard for 4 seconds and repeat the game in one second by adding += to the function
